# HPALMJava
API to interact with HP ALM using REsT calls to fetch information from HP ALM and store in Excel for analysis. 

The API has been developed to provide the rudimentary groundwork required to access information from HP ALM 11.0 with help of REsT API. The API uses REsT specification provider Jersey to perform repetitive manual operations that take significant human efforts and time. 

### FEATURES

*	Gets test-folders, tests, test-instances, test-runs, test-set-folders, test-sets, defects from QC.
*	Fetches the result in form of an XML file which can be stored for future reference. 
*	Has the facility to parse the XML response and fetch required fields from the XML response.

Fork the project and extend it to create, read, update and delete entities of HP ALM.
